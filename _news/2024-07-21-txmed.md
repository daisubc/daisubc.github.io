> From traffic safety, to wildfire mitigation and earthquake resiliency, the UBC and Rogers partnership—first launched in 2018—collaboratively develops new opportunities to explore potential applications for 5G to generate environmental and health benefits for Canadians. Projects bring together diverse research teams of faculty and students with external partners to leverage UBC’s 5G-powered smart campus; a leading-edge and first-of-its-kind infrastructure that was created through the partnership with Rogers. The Timely and Extended Monitoring in Emergencies and Disasters (Tx MED) project is one of these applications. The aim is to use Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, AI and 5G to redefine patient care and facilitate improved outcomes in emergency departments (EDs) by using low-cost wearable system to monitor the vital signs and location of patients. The interdisciplinary and cross-sector Tx MED team brings together engineering and medical researchers, working with health care professionals to investigate new ways to improve emergency room care.
