We are delighted to congratulate [Dr. Shuyuan Wang]({% link _profiles/Shuyuan Wang.md %}) and [Dr. Hashim Migaybil]({% link _profiles/Hashim Migaybil.md %}) on successfully completing their PhD degrees!

**Dr. Shuyuan Wang** focused on the intersection of reinforcement learning and control, developing methods to make RL more efficient by incorporating partial model knowledge. His work has been published at top venues including ICML, NeurIPS, IROS, and IFAC World Congress. Shuyuan will continue in the DAIS Lab as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

**Dr. Hashim Migaybil** worked on performance prediction of photovoltaic assisted single-slope solar stills using machine learning models.

Congratulations to both on this significant achievement! We wish them all the best in their future endeavors.
