description: "Recently, there has been a growing interest in digital learning platforms and immersive technology for teaching, e.g., complex machine operators. This study investigates the use of a Mixed Reality (MR) system for operator training in a thermoforming case study, emphasizing the significance of user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and usability in MR applications. The work proposes a spatial user interface (UI) for MR applications that enables users to interact with virtual objects in the actual environment. Moreover, to enhance the UX, a real-time 3D heat transfer simulation was developed and integrated into the MR application to allow the learner to monitor and control the manufacturing process closely. The proposed framework is validated by an MR headset (Microsoft HoloLens 2). Lastly, a user study with eight participants was conducted, which showed the usability of the app using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, scoring an overall usability rate of ~85/100."
