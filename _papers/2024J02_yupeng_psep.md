description: "Accurate and timely fault diagnosis is a vital task to ensure process safety of modern industrial facilities. Motivated by the complex variations of process signals and mutual coupling of faults, this paper presents a multi-feature-based fault diagnosis method based on the weighted timeliness Broad Learning System (BLS). The proposed method fuses multiple features extracted from the original process data to improve the fault diagnosis performance, and makes the diagnosis model suitable for dynamic fault diagnosis problems by incorporating the BLS. The major contributions of this study are twofolds: 1) A systematic multi-feature extraction method is proposed to extract long-term trend features, short-term trend features, and binary alarm signals, which reflect the direction and amplitude changes of process signals under faulty conditions; 2) a weighted timeliness BLS structure with multiple fault-sensitive features as the input is proposed to ensure the dynamic characteristics of the fault diagnosis model. The designed fault diagnosis model can be updated in an incremental manner, and thus can improve the model updating efficiency while ensuring accuracy. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by a case study based on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process."
