description: "To track the body movement of patients with movement disorders, sensors such as Kinect cameras are not easily accessible. Recently-developed deep learning models, as a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), can analyze patients’ behavior from RGB images of smartphones. The Stacked Hourglass model is a novel pose estimation deep learning model which can accurately determine the location of body joints and a long shortterm memory network (LSTM) can determine the corresponding action by analyzing the kinematic behavior of the body joints. This study develops a deep learning model that uses RGB images from the UT-Kinect dataset as input and determines the action performed with 84.14 % accuracy. Specifically, our contributions are: (i) developed the preprocessing pipeline to use stack hourglass model on the UT-kinect dataset (ii) finetuning of the model to handle 20 joints (iii) Added a human action recognition component to accurately classify the actions performed. Our method can be an efficient replacement for the hardly-accessible Kinect cameras and can be used to analyze various diseases with movement disorders."
