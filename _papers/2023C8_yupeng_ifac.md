description: "In drilling processes, non-stationary phases corresponding to shifts between operating conditions and changes in downhole formations typically lead to false alarms. Extracting these frequent event patterns is critical to build drilling process monitoring and fault diagnosis models. This study aims to extract the frequent event patterns associated with non-stationary phases in drilling time series. In this way, diversified information related to signal changes under normal conditions can be obtained, which is beneficial for suppressing false alarms and improving fault detection performance. The main contributions of this study are twofold: 1) a non-stationary phase detection method is proposed to extract drilling frequent event patterns based on t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and relative unconstrained least-squares importance fitting; 2) an event sequence generation method is proposed to express drilling frequent event patterns with a group of symbols. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by data from a real drilling project."
