description: "We adapt reinforcement learning methods for continuous control to bridge the gap between complete ignorance and perfect knowledge of the environment. Our method, Partial Knowledge Least Squares Policy Iteration (PLSPI), takes inspiration from both model-free RL and model-based control. It uses incomplete information from a partial model and retains RLâ€™s data-driven adaption towards optimal performance. The linear quadratic regulator provides a case study; numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and resulting benefits of the proposed method."
