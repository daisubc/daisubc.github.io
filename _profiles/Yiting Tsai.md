biography: Yiting has obtained both his BASc and MASc degrees at CHBE. His current PhD research is focused on feature extraction, the identification of combined raw input variables which contribute to various process outcomes. This is achieved using Machine Learning algorithms such as Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks. Yiting is also working as a part-time data analyst in a consulting company, where he uses his fluency in Python to design predictive models to forecast and diagnose anomalies for real-time process data.
