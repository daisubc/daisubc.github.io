biography: Faye Hajiali holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from McGill University, where she focused on developing “smart” and sustainable functional materials for the aerospace industry. Following her Ph.D., at McGill's Department of Chemistry, she explored “green” techniques for extracting bioplastics from crustacean shell waste, while also serving as an entrepreneurial lead for scale-up and commercialization. Later, Faye joined Hydron Energy Inc. as a Lead Scientist, contributing to the development of adsorbent materials for RNG upgrading. Recently, Faye has joined the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UBC, aiming to adopt machine learning techniques for advancing materials discovery, thus contributing to the journey towards a net-zero future.
