biography: Originally from Calgary, Daniel moved to Vancouver to pursue a bachelor's degree in engineering at the University of British Columbia. After being allured by the scenic hikes and beaches around the city as well as the interesting research being done by the DAIS Lab, he chose to stay for his master's degree. He is now studying reinforcement learning for use in control systems. Outside of his studies, Daniel enjoys skiing at Cypress Mountain in the winter and hiking around Vancouver in the summer.
