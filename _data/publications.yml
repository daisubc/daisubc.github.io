  description: "Data-driven disciplines such as biostatistics and chemometrics are undergoing a period of transformation propelled by powerful advances in computational hardware, parallel processing and algorithmic efficiency. Process systems engineering is positioned for concurrent advances in data-driven sub-disciplines such as modeling, optimization, control, fault detection and diagnosis. This work embodies this transformation as it addresses a novel industrial fault detection problem from both traditional and contemporary approaches to process analytics. Traditional approaches such as partial least squares are compared with powerful new techniques inspired by deep representation learning such as convolutional neural networks. Novel contributions include the formulation and introduction of a novel industrial predictive classification problem, the design and implementation of a comprehensive machine learning workflow that converts raw industrial data into critical operational insights, and the presentation of a robust comparative analysis between traditional and contemporary approaches to representation learning and binary classification. Specifically, this work addresses the unexpected loss of plasma arc in the electric arc furnace of a large-scale metallurgical process. The objective is to learn an efficient and informative representation from the raw industrial data that enables the prediction of an arc loss event such that operators can take corrective actions. A comprehensive representation learning and predictive classification framework is presented for development of the inferential sensor from large quantities of historical industrial process data."

  description: "Meta-learning is a branch of machine learning which aims to quickly adapt models, such as neural networks, to perform new tasks by learning an underlying structure across related tasks. In essence, models are being trained to learn new tasks effectively rather than master a single task. Meta-learning is appealing for process control applications because the perturbations to a process required to train an AI controller can be costly and unsafe. Additionally, the dynamics and control objectives are similar across many different processes, so it is feasible to create a generalizable controller through meta-learning capable of quickly adapting to different systems. In this work, we construct a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based controller and meta-train the controller using a latent context variable through a separate embedding neural network. We test our meta-algorithm on its ability to adapt to new process dynamics as well as different control objectives on the same process. In both cases, our meta-learning algorithm adapts very quickly to new tasks, outperforming a regular DRL controller trained from scratch. Meta-learning appears to be a promising approach for constructing more intelligent and sampleefficient controllers."

  description: "Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are increasingly pervasive and important in daily life. We present a surrogate modeling approach that uses synthetic data generated by an electrochemical model to approximate Li-ion battery dynamics using a Deep Neural Network. Elechtrochemical models are needed to describe high current operation but are computationally costly. As an initial study, we prototype our approach for the Single Particle Model. We use a battery use-cycle and observations of concentrations and voltages to predict future battery behavior. Given only the use cycle and knowledge that the battery is fully charged, the surrogate model can accurately forecast observations of Li-ion concentrations and voltages for the entire use cycle, as well as give a window of time for battery depletion."

  description: "This paper presents a two-component framework to detect model-plant mismatch (MPM) in cross-directional (CD) processes on paper machines under model-predictive control. First, routine operating data is used for system identification in closed loop; second, a one-class support vector machine (SVM) is trained to predict MPM. The iterative identification method alternates between identifying the finite impulse response coefficients of the spatial and temporal models. It converges, and the parameter estimates are asymptotically consistent. Coefficient estimates drawn from normal operation are used to train a one-class SVM, which then detects model-plant mismatch in subsequent routine operation. This approach applies to routine operating data without requiring external excitations. It can also distinguish mismatches in the process model from changes in the noise model. Examples of CD processes on paper machines are provided to verify the effectiveness of both components."

  description: "We introduce a method for learning provably stable deep neural network based dynamic models from observed data. Specifically, we consider discrete-time stochastic dynamic models, as they are of particular interest in practical applications such as estimation and control. However, these aspects exacerbate the challenge of guaranteeing stability. Our method works by embedding a Lyapunov neural network into the dynamic model, thereby inherently satisfying the stability criterion. To this end, we propose two approaches and apply them in both the deterministic and stochastic settings: one exploits convexity of the Lyapunov function, while the other enforces stability through an implicit output layer. We demonstrate the utility of each approach through numerical examples."

  description: "We develop a model-plant mismatch (MPM) detection strategy based on a novel closed-loop identification approach and one-class support vector machine (SVM) learning technique. With this scheme we can monitor MPM and noise model change separately, thus separating the MPM from noise model changes. Another advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to routine operating data that may lack any external excitation signals. Theoretical analysis of the proposed closed-loop identification is provided in this paper, showing that it can give a consistent parameter estimate for the process model even in the case where a priori knowledge about the true noise model structure is not available. A set of normal operation data with satisfactory performance is collected as the training data."
