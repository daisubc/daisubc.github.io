# Main Settings

## Contact Information
Update your lab and contact information in the `_config.yml` file_

## Front page content
Edit `_includes/research.html` and `_layouts/home.html` to customize the front page

## General Layout Updates
To change the page layout, go to `/_includes` and edit the page partials. The default template can be changed in `_layouts`. Some pages can be edited directly in the markdown files contained in the root directory.

# Dynamic Content Updates

## Publications
Lab publications are displayed in each team member's profiles dynamically using the `team_profile_pubs.html` partial. The Liquid code loops through all papers in `site.data.publications` and displays the publication if the team member's `title` or `pub_name` variable, as configured in the `_profiles` folder, matches a name in the author list.

# Content Updates

## New News Articles
To update the news page with new articles, go to `/_news` and create a new markdown file. Use the existing articles as a template.

## New Publications
To update or add new entries to the publications page, go to `/_data/publications.yml`. Use the existing publications as a template.

## Group Members Page Update
1. Create a new `.md` file in the `/_profiles/` folder. Use the existing profiles as a template for the variable names.
2. Place your profile picture in the `/assets/profile` photo. Please crop your photo to a squarish shape and keep the filesize to something reasonable.

## Graduating Members
Graduating members are moved to `_data/alumni.yml`. The `status` variable in `_profiles` is set to `alumni` to disable the profile from being displayed in the teams page.
